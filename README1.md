# Let's create a ready README.md file with the adjusted content for Haitham's project.

readme_content = """# 🌱 Plant Disease Detection 🔎

Plant Disease Detection is a machine learning project that uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **deep learning** techniques to detect and classify plant diseases from leaf images.  
The main goal is to provide farmers and researchers with a tool for **fast and accurate plant health diagnosis**, helping in timely treatment and reducing crop losses.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project contains the following main components:

- `Plant_Disease_Detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for training the model.
- `main_app.py`: Streamlit web app for disease prediction.
- `plant_disease_model.keras`: Pre-trained model file.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.

## 🚀 Installation

To run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/Plant-Disease-Detection.git
   cd Plant-Disease-Detection


2. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment:**


Always show details

Copy code
conda create -n plant_env python=3.10
conda activate plant_env

3. **Install the required packages:**
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Run the Streamlit app:**
streamlit run main_app.py

**🌿 Usage**
Once the app is running, open your browser at http://localhost:8501.
Upload a leaf image (JPG, PNG, JPEG), and the app will predict:

The Plant 🌱
The Disease 🐛
The Confidence Score ✅

**🧠 Model Training**

Model trained on 70,000+ leaf images across 38 plant disease classes.

Used MobileNetV2 as base model (transfer learning).

Input image size: 96x96.

Best accuracy achieved: 95%+ on validation data.

Saved model file: plant_disease_model.keras.

**🌐 Web Application**

The Streamlit app (main_app.py) allows interactive use of the trained model:

Upload an image.

Get instant prediction with disease confidence score.
